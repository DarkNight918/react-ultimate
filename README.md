# React Ultimate

Tired of **React Starters** reexplaining another hello-world?

Dreamt of something closer to the industry?

Welcome to **React Ultimate** then. This project is fairly experimental but we've already
got much of interesting experience observations during development. Just give it a try.

[Demo instance](http://react-starter.paqmind.com/) (may be outdated to GitHub version).

## Install

```
$ wget https://github.com/Paqmind/react-starter/archive/master.zip; unzip master.zip -d react-starter; rm master.zip
$ cd react-starter
$ npm install; bower install; bin/install
```

### Temporary workaround

See https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab-react/issues/26
We use a temporary https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin/baobab-react fork to workaround this.

Run this to convert ES6 -> ES5 syntaxes.
```
$ cd node_modules/baobab-react
$ npm run prepublish
$ cd ../../
```

## Run

Production
```
$ npm start
```

Development
```
$ npm run nodemon [terminal-1]
$ npm run dev     [terminal-2]
```

## Architecture

All React starters / tutorials suffer from being oversimplified.
They don't show any architecture (the most complex part), only a basic file layouts at their best.
TodoApps have similar issues: very specific, single page only, unrealistic models (one field),
no backend, no validation, no users, etc.
We want to approach this differently – provide application which is close to real-world examples.

We also want to test-n-proof Domain Driven architecture (we are bored of models/controllers/views folders
at the root).

### Flux vs Baobab

We don't use Flux. Check next links for a shallow information *Why*:

### Relative imports

One of the NodeJS biggest fails – the absence of relative imports. Fortunately they can be emulated with
some amount of twist. The requirement here is to keep IDE navigation and autocompletion features working.
Script **bin/linkfolders** symlinks application entry points in **node_modules**. Every such point must contain distinct
**package.json** to be compatible with Browserify expectations. But now you may replace all those
ugly, unreadable, unsupportable relative imports with brand shiny absolute.

### Immutable

We tried to use [Immutable](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js) and [Mori](https://github.com/swannodette/mori)
but the resulting code was extremely bloated and noisy. The potential for bugs was surely increased rather
than reduced. We still considering [Seamless-Immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable) though.

### Builds

Despite ES6, builds are quite fast thanks to Watchify, Babelify and parallel execution (spawns).
Only app files are under constant watching. All vendors go to separate bundle.

### Browserify vs WebPack.

We're going to switch to WebPack a bit later.

### Browser Sync (live reload)

Will be available with WebPack builds.
