# React Starter

[Demo instance.](http://react-starter.paqmind.com/)

There are a few of react-starters out there. Let's compare.

## Remarks

### Architecture

All React starters / tutorials suffer from being oversimplified.
They don't show any architecture (the most complex part), only a basic file layouts at their best.
TodoApps have similar issues: very specific, single page only, unrealistic models (one field),
no backend, no validation, no users, etc.
We want to approach this differently – provide application which is close to real-world examples.

We also want to test-n-proof Domain Driven architecture (we are bored of models/controllers/views folders
at the root).

### Relative imports

One of the Node.js biggest fails – the absence of relative imports. Fortunately they can be emulated with
some amount of twist. The requirement here is to keep IDE navigation and autocompletion features working.
Script **bin/linkfolders** symlinks application entry points in **node_modules**. Every such point must contain distinct
**package.json** to be compatible with Browserify expectations. But now you may replace all those
ugly, unreadable, unsupportable relative imports with brand shiny absolute.

### Browser Sync (live reload)

We believe they create more complexity and usability issues than solve.
As soon as you do something more complex than changing component text you can't be sure
that your browser is really updated after syntax error or something.
So you'll constantly force refresh anyway...

### Browserify vs WebPack.

Just look at this [mess](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/webpack.config.js).
We prefer to keep everything simple with Browserify.

### Builds

Despite ES6, builds are quite fast thanks to Watchify, Babelify and parallel execution (spawns).
Only app files are under constant watching. All vendors go to separate bundle.
