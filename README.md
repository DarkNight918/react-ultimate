There are a few of react-starters out there. Let's compare.

## Remarks

### Architecture

All React starters / tutorials suffer from being oversimplified.
They don't show any architecture (the most complex part), only a basic file layouts at their best.
TodoApps have similar issues: very specific, single page only, unrealistic models (one field),
no backend, no validation, no users, etc.
We want to approach this differently – provide application which is close to real-world examples.

We also want to test-n-proof Domain Driven architecture (we are bored of models/controllers/views folders
at the root).

### Immutable

[Immutable-js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/) may replace the majority of use-cases
for Lodash. So we try to use this on both frontend and backend.
Unfortunately, it turns out not as easy as expected.

### Browser Sync (live reload)

We believe they create more complexity and usability issues than solve.
As soon as you do something more complex than changing component text you can't be sure
that your browser is really updated after syntax error or something.
So you'll constantly force refresh anyway...

### Browserify vs WebPack.

Don't like this [mess](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/webpack.config.js).
Trying to stay with Browserify.

### Builds

Despite ES6, builds are quite fast thanks to Watchify, Babelify and parallel execution (spawns).
Only app files are under constant watching. All vendors go to separate bundle.
