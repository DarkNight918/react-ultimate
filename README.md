## Remarks

### Architecture
All React starters / tutorials suffer from being oversimplified.
They don't show any architecture (the most complex part), only a basic file layouts at their best.
We want to approach this differently – provide more close to real-world reference application.
TodoApps have similar issues: very specific, single page only, unrealistic models (one field),
no backend, no validation, no users, etc.

We also want to test-n-proof Domain Driven architecture (we are bored of models/controllers/views folders
at the root).

### Browser Sync
No Browser Sync cause it creates more complexity and usability issues than solves.
May break on errors leaving you wondering whether it were updated or not.

### Browserify vs WebPack.
Don't like this [mess](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/webpack.config.js)
Trying to stay with Browserify.
