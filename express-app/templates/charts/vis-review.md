## Vis.js Graph2d

Benefits

+ same datastructures among all **vis.js** components
+ customizable
+ free to use
+ I've got a quick answer on GitHub about missing feature from devs

Drawbacks

- annoying zoom and scroll capture (require hacks to disable it for now)
- not interactive
- shallow documentation
- some examples freeze right on their site
- I experienced irregular page freezes too
- <a href="https://github.com/almende/vis/issues/452">no horizontal bars!</a>
- strange bar grouping style (dancing widths, see below)
