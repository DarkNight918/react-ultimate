# Choosing a chart library

There are <a href="http://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/javascript-graphs-and-charts-libraries" target="_blank">multitude</a>
of options for this. I had a very positive experience with **HighCharts** in the past and we gonna use timeline
from **vis.js** so lets compare this two.

Both libraries (as most of the others) render charts to SVG. Both libraries have no dependencies:
**vis.js** -- at all, and **HighCharts** with a special standalone version,
(**HighCharts** depends on jQuery by default). Both may be customized to nearly the same look.
Hovewer I tweaked only a few options to keep default "feeling" as well.
