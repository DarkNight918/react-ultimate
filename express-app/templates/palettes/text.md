# Choosing a color palette

Exact usage of palette colors is undefined. It's more of a direction than
a concrete answer. Palette is only one aspect of the resulting picture. It's possible
to combine bright colors with chary shapes or apply pastel palette to otherwise
funky design with equally great results.

Color preference is subjective and there is always a choice between going mainstream or alternative.
In any case, resulting view should be a balanced one. If we chose tender colors
we should have more "contrast" in other parts. We'd likely end up with bigger
corner radius for example. If we go with more saturated ones, we'll be more restrained with curves.

I chose arguably suitable colors for this project. They are, mostly, of middle
saturation. I think it's good to start with recognizable palette for a startup.
It's better to leave boring color combos for corporations. They obtain
a memorizing effect with massive repetition &mdash; we can't afford such luxury.

As for colors, I think fitting ones are: blue, brown, violet, yellow.
Blue is a de-facto standard color for IT, and social, and everything, and it's kinda overused.
So it's better to go with a distinctive hue, at least. Brown is second good
"business" color in its cooler hues. Violet is expressive and associates with passed time
(recall that blue and violet are default link colors in all browsers...)
which is close to ideas behind project.

Yellow associates with mind, thinking and may add a bit of friendliness to
otherwise serious color set. So there are palettes with yellow tones too.
And, yet another color, is Teal. It's also very popular for IT related stuff.

I found many of this palettes with corresponding tags like "time" or "loyalty".
So, at least, we may be sure someone else has associations with this colors,
that are close to the subject. Palettes are clickable.

Time aspect of the project may influence our choice in different ways.
Just for example, we may go with vintage colors (or just with a subtle hint to them)
over an otherwise modern interface and it may be great and recognizable.
See how Flask ecosystem has chosen vintage logos for framework and extensions
to get a feeling that everything is possible.

</ul>

I'm totally understand that choosing a palette without an immediate visual
feedback may be extremely hard. But we need to narrow down an infinite number
of possibilities to start with. In colors, in shapes, in libraries and so on.
So why no try to?
